     <p>[Baqarah 2:187] Going to your wives during the nights of the fast is made lawful for you; they are coverings for you and you are coverings for them; Allah knows that you were deceiving yourselves (in this respect), so He accepted your penance and forgave you; so cohabit with them and seek what Allah has destined for you – and eat and drink until the white thread becomes distinct to you from the black thread at dawn – then complete the fast till nightfall; and do not touch women while staying in seclusion for worship in the Masjid; these are the limits imposed by Allah, so do not go near them; this is how Allah explains His verses to mankind so that they may attain piety</p>
